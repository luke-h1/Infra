## TODO

- Add blackbox and sec groups for probes (https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter)
- Figure out how to add yace exporter instead of just node exporter (https://github.com/nerdswords/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter)
- Play around with using the cloudwatch exporter in grafana (https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/aws-cloudwatch/)
- Add alerting rules
- Add dashboards
- Add prometheus rules
- ensure config is stateful and not lost on restart/deploys
